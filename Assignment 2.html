<h1 align="center">Stacks, recursion, and games</h1>

<p align="center"><b>Due: 26 Sep 2012</b> (The deadline for part 2 alone is extended to 1 Oct)</p>

<p align="center"><b>Note: This project has two parts. The first part is an individual assignment. In the second part, you may work in a group if you wish to.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Part 1 (80 %)</b></p>


<p><b>Educational objectives:</b>
</p><ul>
 <li> <em><b>Primary objectives:</b></em> Experience implementing stacks, using recursive function calls, analyzing the runtime of your code.<p></p>
 </li></ul>

<p><b>Statement of work:</b> (i) Implement a generic <code>Vector</code> class and adapt it to create a <em>stack</em> class, and (ii) evaluate a recursive function given below.</p>

<p><b>Deliverables:</b> 
</p><ul>
<li>Turn in a <code>makefile</code> and
all header (*.h) and cpp (*.cpp) files that are needed to build your
software, as described in <a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~asriniva/courses/DS12/HWinstructions.html">www.cs.fsu.edu/~asriniva/courses/DS12/HWinstructions.html</a>. Turn in your development log too, which should be a plain ASCII text file called <code>LOG.txt</code> in your project directory. 
</li></ul>



<p><b>Requirements:</b></p>

<ul>
 <li>Create
     a subdirectory called <code>proj2</code>.</li>
 <li>You
     will need to have a <code>makefile</code> in this directory. In addition, all the
     header and cpp files needed to build your software must be present here, as well as the <code>LOG.txt</code> file.</li>
<li> You should create the following additional files.
<ul>
<li><em>Vector.h:</em> This should implement a generic <code>Vector</code> class with at least the following features: (i) a default constructor, (ii) a destructor, (iii)  <code>void push_back(const T &amp;e)</code>, (iv) the operator <code>[]</code>, and (v) <code>int size()</code>.
</li><li><em>Stack.h:</em> This should implement a generic <code>Stack</code> class with at least the following features: (i)  <code>void push(T &amp;)</code>, (ii)  <code>void pop()</code>, (iii)  <code>T &amp;top()</code>, and (iv)  <code>bool empty()</code>.
</li><li><em>Other files:</em> You may use more files.
</li><li><em>main.cpp:</em> This is the main program. The command: <code>./recurse N<sub>1</sub> C<sub>1</sub> A<sub>1</sub> M<sub>1</sub> M<sub>2</sub> M<sub>3</sub> M<sub>4</sub> D<sub>1</sub> D<sub>2</sub> S<sub>1</sub> S<sub>2</sub> Arg Op </code> will cause the function given below to be evaluated recursively, and the answer output. The function is defined as follows.
<p><code>f(N) = 0</code>, if <code>N &lt; N<sub>1</sub></code>
</p><p><code>f(N<sub>1</sub>) = C<sub>1</sub></code>
</p><p> <code>f(N)= A<sub>1</sub> + M<sub>1</sub>*f(M<sub>2</sub>*N/D<sub>1</sub> - S<sub>1</sub>) <em>Op</em> M<sub>3</sub>*f(M<sub>4</sub>*N/D<sub>2</sub> - S<sub>2</sub>)</code>, if <code>N &gt; N<sub>1</sub></code>
</p><p> Here, <code>f(Arg)</code> needs to be evaluated. N<sub>1</sub> C<sub>1</sub> A<sub>1</sub> M<sub>1</sub> M<sub>2</sub> M<sub>3</sub> M<sub>4</sub> D<sub>1</sub> D<sub>2</sub> S<sub>1</sub> S<sub>2</sub>, Arg are integers and <em>Op</em> is either <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>. The division performed is the usual integer division with truncation.

</p><p><b>Example:</b>
</p><p><code> Prompt&gt; ./recurse 2 3 2 1 2 0 1 3 6 0 0 18 +</code>
</p><p><code>13</code> (program output)

</p></li><li> <em>Analysis.pdf:</em> This file should contain the following. (i) The asymptotic time complexity for evaluation of the recursive function as a function of all arguments to the executable <code>recurse</code> which influence the running time of that program. For the analysis alone, assume that <code>S<sub>1</sub> = S<sub>2</sub> = 0</code>, <code>M<sub>2</sub> = M<sub>4</sub> = 1</code>, and <code>D<sub>1</sub> = D<sub>2</sub> &gt; 1</code>. Briefly justify the results of your analysis. (ii) Amortized time complexity for <code>N</code> <code>push</code> operations on the stack. Briefly justify your analysis.

</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p><b>Sample executable:</b> A sample executable is available at ~cop4530/fall12/solutions/proj2/recurse on <code>linprog</code>. The first person to find errors in our program will get a bonus point!</p>


<p><b>Notes: </b>
</p><ol>

<li> You should not use STL containers, other than the <code>string</code> class. Please get my written
permission before using any other STL feature.

</li><li> <b>You will need to pass certain components of this assignment to pass this course.</b>

<p align="center"><b>Part 2 (20 %)</b></p>

<p><b>Educational objectives:</b>
</p><ul>
 <li> <em><b>Primary objectives:</b></em> Using recursion to evaluate a game tree, implementing a tic-tac-toe code that uses a game tree.<p></p>
 </li><li> <em><b>Secondary objectives:</b></em> Developing a good user interface, developing a strategy to play tic-tac-toe well.<p></p>
</li></ul>

<p><b>Statement of work:</b> Write a program to play tic-tac-toe. Your program should accept moves from a human, and should make good moves in its turn, in trying to win the game. </p>


<p><b>Background:</b> Tic-tac-toe is normally played with a <i>3x3</i> array.  This can be generalized to
bigger arrays. All cells in the array are initially unmarked. Two players
take turns marking previously unmarked cells, with the first player
making an <i>X</i><span style="font-style:normal"> mark and the second
player making a </span><i>0</i><span style="font-style:normal">
mark. The game ends if (i) either player wins, or (ii) the game is
tied, because neither player wins. A player wins if he has a specified
number of consecutive marks along a line. These consecutive marks can
either be along a horizontal line, a vertical line, or a diagonal. A
diagonal is as explained below. Let the cells be numbered so that the
bottom left cell is denoted by </span><i>(1,1)</i><span style="font-style:normal"> and the top right by
</span><i>(n,n)</i><span style="font-style:normal"> in an </span><i>n
x n</i><span style="font-style: normal"> array. A diagonal going
North-East will have cell </span><i>(i+1,j+1)</i><span style="font-style:normal"> adjacent to cell </span><i>(i,j)</i><span style="font-style:normal">, while a cell going North-West will has
cell </span><i>(i-1,j+1)</i><span style="font-style:normal"> adjacent
to cell (i,j). <a href="http://boulter.com/ttt/">http://boulter.com/ttt/</a> has an
example of a tic-tac-toe game. They permit an array that has a height
different from its width. But we will require the height and the width
to be equal. You should evaluate <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yosenl/extras/alphabeta/alphabeta.html">game trees</a> with recursion to try to win the game.  

</span></p><p><b>Deliverables:</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>Create
     a subdirectory called <code>TicTacToe</code>.</li>
 <li>You
     will need to have a <code>makefile</code> in this directory. In addition, all the
     header and cpp files needed to build your software must be present here, as well as the <code>LOG.txt</code> file.</li>
<li> You should create the following additional file.
<ul>
<li><em>main.cpp:</em> This is the main program. It will accept three command
line arguments. The command: <code>./proj2 &lt;n&gt; &lt;m&gt; &lt;h/c&gt;</code>
will cause a tic-tac-toe game to be played using an <i>n x n</i> array, with <i>m</i> marks in a line needed to win. The argument <i>h</i> will cause the human to play first, while a <i>c</i> will cause the computer to play first. For example, <code>./proj2
4 3 h</code> will play a tic-tac-toe game on
a <i>4x4</i> array, with <i>3</i> consecutive marks required to win, and the human
playing first. Whenever it is the human's turn to play, the program should
present the current state of the game, and specify how the human should let the
computer know about his/her move. The human has unlimited time to make a move.
However, the computer should complete its move within <i>5</i> seconds. The program should also give the correct
final result of the game.

</li></ul>
</li></ul>

 <p><b>Notes: </b>
</p><ol>

<li> You can get up to 10 bonus points if your code wins a tic-tac-toe tournament that we will organize, competing against other tic-tac-toe programs. 

</li><li> You will be graded on your user interface too.

</li><li> You may use any STL feature for this part of the assignment.

</li><li> You must use a game tree for at least a few levels of recursion, after which you may use some intelligent strategy to evaluate a position.

</li><li> You may form groups of up to 4 students each if you wish to. In this case, please email me the names of all group members by Sep 15, with a cc to each group member, and also include the names of the group members in the log file.

</li><li> The size of the problem will be at most <code>10 x 10</code>.
