<h1 align="center">Find the relevance of documents</h1>

<p align="center"><b>Due: 7 Nov 2012</b></p>

<p><b>Educational objectives:</b> Implement a self-restructuring binary search tree, develop test cases to test the correctness of your software, and empirically compare the performance for different data structures.</p>

<p><b>Statement of work:</b> (i) Implement a self-restructuring binary search tree class that self-restructures as specified below and (ii) implement a document retrieval program, which is a modification of that in assignment 3, but using your self-restructuring binary search tree to store the list of words in each document. You should <b>not</b> use an STL <code>map</code> or <code>set</code> in your implementation.</p>

<p><b>Deliverables:</b> Turn in a <code>makefile</code> and
all header (*.h) and cpp (*.cpp) files that are needed to build your
software. Turn in your development log too, which should be a plain ASCII text file called <code>LOG.txt</code> in your project directory. You will submit all of these as described in <a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~asriniva/courses/DS12/HWinstructions.html">www.cs.fsu.edu/~asriniva/courses/DS12/HWinstructions.html</a>.  </p>

<p><b>Requirements:</b></p>

<ul>
 <li>Create
     a subdirectory called <code>proj4</code>.</li>
 <li>You
     will need to have a <code>makefile</code> in this directory. In addition, all the
     header and cpp files needed to build your software must be present here, as well as the <code>LOG.txt</code> file.</li>
 <li>You
     should implement appropriate classes for the software. Your code should be well designed and object oriented. </li>
  <li>Your software's main task is as follows. A user will give it queries consisting of a set of words. For each query, the software should give the most relevant documents that contain all words in that query.
     </li>
 <li>The
     software is run by the user on the command
     line, as follows:</li>
 <ul>
  <li><code>Retrieve Filename-List</code>, where  <code>Filename-List</code>  is a list of file names of zero or more ASCII text documents.</li>
 </ul>

 <li> The software first <em>analyzes</em> each file given on the command line. Details of the analysis are explained later. The software then waits for a series of user actions, and responds to each user action as described below. 
  

<p>Possible user actions and required software response:
</p></li>

 <ul>
  <li><code>a Filename</code>: <em>Analyze</em> the ASCII text file
 <code>Filename</code>. If this file has already been analyzed
 previously, then replace the results of the previous analysis with
 the current one. If the file does not exist, then output <code>File
 Filename does not exist</code> to standard output (not to standard
 error). This command reads each word in the file. Each time a
 <b>new</b> word is encountered, it is inserted into your self-restructuring binary search tree
  (there is a distinct tree for each document).  </li>

  <li><code>q n Word-List</code>: <code>n</code> is a positive integer
  and <code>Word-List</code> is a list of <em>words</em> (this is
  defined later) separated by one or more blanks. The software returns
  a list of the <code>n</code> most relevant documents containing all
  the words in <code>Word-List</code>. If fewer than <code>n</code>
  documents match the query, then all the matching documents are
  returned. Each line of the output will first give the name of a
  document, followed by a blank, followed by the document's
  <code>relevance</code>, which is a floating point number defined
  later. The documents are output in decreasing order of relevance
  (that is, most relevant document first). If no document matches,
  then output <code>No matching document</code> to standard
  output. This command also self-restructures the binary search tree for each
  document as follows. For each word in the word list that is found,
  that word is moved two steps up in the tree using rotations 
  (unless it
  is already in the first or second level, in which case it is made the root).


</li><li><code>p n Filename</code>: <code>n</code> is a positive integer and <code>Filename</code> is the name of a file that has previously been analyzed. If this file has not been analyzed previously, then output <code>File Filename has not been analyzed</code> to standard error. Otherwise, output the first <code>n</code> words in a pre-order traversal of the tree storing the words in <code>Filename</code>.

  </li><li><code>x</code>: Quit the program.</li>

  <li>Output <code>Invalid command</code> to standard output for any other command. </li>
 </ul>


 <p></p><li> <em>Analysis</em> of a document. In this process, the
 software will identify the set of <em>words</em> in the
 document. Each word will be given a floating point
 <em>weight</em>. The weight of a word is the ratio of the frequency
 of its occurrence to the total number of words in the document. You
 should store the weights of each word, of each document analyzed, in
 a suitable container.

<p> A <em>word</em> is defined as a sequences of adjacent characters in the input file,
 separated by any of the following delimiters: whitespace (blanks, tabs, and newlines) or any of the following <b><code>! ( ) - : ; " , . ? /</code></b>. (A delimiter cannot be a part of any word.)  Note that <code>abandon</code> and <code>Abandon</code> are different words, as are <code>car</code> and <code>car's</code>.  

 </p><p></p></li><li> <em>Relevance</em> of a document. A document is relevant to a query only if it contains each word in the query. If a document contains each word in the query, then its relevance is defined as the sum of the weights, in this document, of all the words in the query.

<p></p></li><li><em>Result.txt:</em> This is an ASCII text file. You should first describe how you tested your binary search tree code (for example, what types of possible errors did you check for). You should then compare the performance of your code against that for the one from assignment 3. Under what circmstances is the current code faster?
</li></ul>

<p><b>Sample file and executable:</b> No sample executable will be provided. You need to write good test cases to check the correctness of your program.</p>

<p><b>Bonus points:</b> 

</p><p> You will get 3 bonus points if your code is faster than our sample executable on some large tests which we will announce after the submission deadline. (Your code should also be correct.)

</p><p> You may get up to 5 additional points for significant extra work, such as implementing more features (for example, determining that different forms of the same word, such as <code>serve</code>, <code>served</code>, <code>serving</code>, and <code>serves</code> are equivalent) or providing a GUI interface. Please obtain written permission from me prior to doing this. If you wish to get bonus points, then please submit your work as usual, but send an email to the John Nguyen. John will schedule a meeting with you, and you can demonstrate the special features of your software then.</p>
