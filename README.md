# Data Structures, Algorithms and Generic Programming

Programming assignments written for COP4530, taught by Ashok Srinivasan in Fall 2012.

The original assignment requirements are in the base folder while each project folder contains the deliverable code and log file.

* Assignment 1 - Using an STL container and its iterator, implement a simple program that analyzes a list of files and allows a user to enter a list of words which will return the most relevant documents that contain all such words.

* Assignment 2, part 1 - Implement a generic Vector class and adapt it to create a stack class. Additionally, evaluate a recursive function.

* Assignment 2, part 2 - Using a Red-Black game tree, implement a program that plays a perfect game of tic-tac-toe with an arbitrary grid size. The program should complete a move within 5 seconds.

* Assignment 3 - Implement a linked list class that self-organizes itself and apply it to the document retrieval program from assignment 1 instead of using STL containers.

* Assignment 4 - Implement a self-restructuring binary search tree and apply it to the document retrival program from assignment 1 instead of using STL containers.

* Assignment 5 - Implement several data structures and write a program to compare the performance of each on various actions. Design and analyze custom data structure to efficiently store and search for words.
