The following tests were performed to test the BST class:

- First a print function was written to show the tree in a 90 degree rotation, so that it is clear which nodes are children and leaves and so on. This is essentially in making sure the tree is correct.
- A driver was written to perform a series of inserts and deletes. The insertions and deletions are confirmed to be correct when printing the tree.
- The driver was re-written to use the copy constructor to test the clone and operator= functions. There was a bug that occured when the copy constructor did not initialize root to NULL, causing segfaults.
- The driver was rewritten to use several data types to ensure the template works properly. Tested were int, double, std::string, and the word class written for the assignment.
- findMin, findMax, and contains were tested and confirmed through the printTree function. 
- Finally the assignment specific functions were tested, specifically get and getAndUpdate. This test was performed through the main.cpp interface, since it would not function without correct results.

The BST implementation performs faster queries than the DLL but slower analyses, though the time difference for small inputs is negligible.
