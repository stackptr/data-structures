Nov 22, 2012
  * Created compare.cpp and makefile
  * Using one map to map a filename to one type of container
  * Implemented STL set container
Nov 24, 2012:
  * Added timing code via <ctime>. It appears find() is very fast for set.
  * Added unordered_set implementation.
Nov 27, 2012:
  * Implemented MyHash object and myhash container.
  * Tried cputime.h instead of <ctime>, still results in no time recorded for find().
  * Began MyDS class, using vector.h and list.h from previous assignments.
